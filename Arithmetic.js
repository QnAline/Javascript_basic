// % for remainder
let num=3
//num +=1
//++num    pre increment 
//num++  post inncrement

//illustrating difference between pre nd post increment
let x=num++//x=3 since num will assignned to x and incrementation will happen after

console.log(num,x)
x=++num
console.log(num,x)

// TO FIND POWER ** or you can use Math.power(3,3)
console.log(3**3)
